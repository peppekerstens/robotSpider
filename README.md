# robotSpider

A few years ago i bought myself metal kit and a bunch of servos. After putting it together mechanically, this has mostly been gathering dust ever since. From now on, i will try to document my efforts convert these parts into a walking robotic spider. As it may have become clear; this is an ongoing project which (i hope) will help me gain knowledge the aspects of (robot) making and tinkering in all sorts and ways.

I have a technical education and background. My daily job involves architecting and developing IT service infrastructures. Lately i have adhered a DevOps workstyle and am increasingly coding in Azure/PowerShell....working towards C# and Python. However, I am by no means an educated programmer or an expert in any of the technical and mechanical challenges involved in making a robot.

## Examples

There some great examples of robotic spiders out there on the Internet:

But my main influence was a youtube movie (for which i can't seem the find the link any more)

## Goals

To keep focus, my goals for this project are limited to:

1. Get the thing to walk
2. Get it to obey to commands
3. Get it to walk better
4. Get it to sense obstacles
5. Get it to sense its surroundings

To provide some insight in these goals, i will elaborate on them shortly below

### Get the thing to walk

At this stage, any way of moving is acceptable but a motion which assembles a spider-like moving gate is better.

### Get it to obey commands

Think of walk - stop - left - right - backwards - crawl(?). Wireless would be nice, wired is fine.

### Get it to walk better

At this stage, advanced motion like 

## Constraints

No complete kit
'Of the shelf' mechanical parts

## Materials

You could buy a complete kit of course. But a large portion of this endeavior is the journey itself (or so i keep trying to convince myself)

## Some background investigation

Moving
To move 

Kinematics
This is the part i dread the most. kinematics describes the motion of points, bodies (objects), and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without considering the forces that caused the motion

Gates
A multi-ped organism can walk in different ways. This is called gates. For now, 





There is a whole list of goals to be met with this project.



Why a spider?

I can only think of a few other types of organisms that people generally find scary
